### About [ about ]
about:
  title: "About Me"
  text: "
  <p>
    My name is Matthew Jupp. I have been developing unique and innovative projects with firms since 2018. 
    It is my goal to help businesses build stronger communities, economies and nations. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My approach to strategy and analysis is uniquely informed by a collage of different experiences both academic and professional.
    In 2022 I graduatead with a master's in political studies [international relations] from Queen's University. Previously, I earned a bachelors degree in honours economics from Wilfrid Laurier University.
    Extensive research and discussion in these fields have allowed me to develop an eclectic knowledge base in my professional career.
  </p>
  <p>
    I began working professionally with co-op placements in finacial services. There I learned about project management, business analysis and process design.
    My direction shifted in 2019 and I found myself working as a marketing and support specialist for a growth-stage tech start-up.  
    In 2020 I began working for a sports development company, where I became the primary operations manager and designer of most of the firm's databases, websites and marketing campaigns.
    I continue to hunt for new and challenging opportunities where I can offer my talents, effort and ingenuity. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am driven by a desire to create, build and innovate. If you are looking for someone who can fill this kind of role, please do not hesistate to contact me.
